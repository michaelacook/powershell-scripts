# Powershell Scripts

As I am in the midst of learning Azure and Windows Server administration, I am attemping to learn as much Powershell as possible. This repository is a collection of the scripts I am writing, for practice as well as for quickly automating some of the pointy-clicky tasks that can absorb a lot of time when one is doing things inside graphical tools like AD Users and Computers, etc.

I want this repo to be a record of my learning progress and a quick reference for basic language syntax, commands and control structures.

Feel free to clone and share.
